      <t>This memo updates the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) Framework RFC
      2330 with new considerations for measurement methodology and testing.
      The memo updates the definition of standard-formed packets in RFC 2330
      to include coverage of IPv6 packets. It also augments examples of
      distinguishing aspects of packets, referred to as Type-P for test
      packets.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first created a
      framework for metric development in <xref target="RFC2330"/>. This
      framework has stood the test of time and enabled development of many
      fundamental metrics. It has been updated in the area of metric
      composition <xref target="RFC5835"/>, and in several areas related to
      active stream measurement of modern networks with reactive properties
      <xref target="RFC7312"/>.</t>

      <t>The IPPM framework <xref target="RFC2330"/> recognized (in section
      13) that many aspects of IP packets can influence its processing during
      transfer across the network.</t>

      <t>In Section 15 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>, the notion of a
      "standard-formed" packet is defined. However, the definition was never
      updated to include IPv6, as the original authors planned.</t>

      <t>Other header features have come into wide use. This memo seeks to
      provide the needed updates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Scope">
      <t>The purpose of this memo is to expand the coverage of IPPM metrics to
      include IPv6, and to highlight additional aspects of test packets and
      make them part of the IPPM performance metric framework.</t>

      <t>The scope is to update key sections of <xref target="RFC2330"/>,
      adding considerations that will aid the development of new measurement
      methodologies intended for today's IP networks. Specifically, this memo
      expands the Type-P examples in section 13 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>
      and expands the definition (in section 15 of <xref target="RFC2330"/>)
      of a standard-formed packet to include IPv6 header aspects and other
      features.</t>

      <t>Other topics in <xref target="RFC2330"/> which might be updated or
      augmented are deferred to future work. This includes the topics of
      passive and various forms of hybrid active/passive measurements.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Packets of Type-P">
      <t>A fundamental property of many Internet metrics is that the value of
      the metric depends on the type of IP packet(s) used to make the
      measurement. Consider an IP-connectivity metric: one obtains different
      results depending on whether one is interested in connectivity for
      packets destined for well-known TCP ports or unreserved UDP ports, or
      those with invalid IP checksums, or those with TTL or Hop Limit of 16,
      for example. In some circumstances these distinctions will be highly
      interesting (for example, if Diffserv <xref target="RFC2780"/>, ECN
      <xref target="RFC3168"/>, Router Alert, hop-by-hop extensions <xref
      target="RFC7045"/>, or Flow Labels <xref target="RFC6437"/> are used, or
      in the presence of firewalls or RSVP reservations).</t>

      <t>Because of this distinction, we introduce the generic notion of a
      "packet of Type-P", where in some contexts P will be explicitly defined
      (i.e., exactly what type of packet we mean), partially defined (e.g.,
      "with a payload of B octets"), or left generic. Thus we may talk about
      generic IP-Type-P-connectivity or more specific
      IP-port-HTTP-connectivity. Some metrics and methodologies may be
      fruitfully defined using generic Type-P definitions which are then made
      specific when performing actual measurements.</t>

      <t>If the information constituting Type-P at the Source was found to
      have changed at the Destination, then the modified values SHOULD be
      noted and reported with the results.</t>

      <t>Whenever a metric's value depends on the type of the packets involved
      in the metric, the metric's name will include either a specific type or
      a phrase such as "Type-P". Thus we will not define an "IP-connectivity"
      metric but instead an "IP-Type-P-connectivity" metric and/or perhaps an
      "IP-port-HTTP-connectivity" metric. This naming convention serves as an
      important reminder that one must be conscious of the exact type of
      traffic being measured.</t>

      <t>A closely related note: it would be very useful to know if a given
      Internet component treats equally a class C of different types of
      packets. If so, then any one of those types of packets can be used for
      subsequent measurement of the component. This suggests we devise a
      metric or suite of metrics that attempt to determine C.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Standard-Formed Packets">
      <t>Unless otherwise stated, all metric definitions that concern IP
      packets include an implicit assumption that the packet is
      *standard-formed*. A packet is standard-formed if it meets all of the
      following criteria:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="+">Its length as given in the IP header corresponds to
          the size of the IP header (including extension headers) plus the
          size of the payload.</t>

          <t hangText="+">It includes a valid IP header: see below for
          version-specific criteria.</t>

          <t hangText="+">It is not an IP fragment.</t>

          <t hangText="+">The source and destination addresses correspond to
          the intended Source and Destination, including Multicast Destination
          addresses.</t>

          <t hangText="+">If a transport header is present, it contains a
          valid checksum and other valid fields.</t>
        </list>Additionally, an IPv4 packet is standard-formed if it meets the
      following criteria:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The version field is 4; the header length is &gt;= 5; the
          checksum is correct.</t>

          <t>Either the packet possesses sufficient TTL to travel from the
          source to the destination if the TTL is decremented by one at each
          hop, or it possesses the maximum TTL of 255.</t>

          <t>It does not contain IP options unless explicitly noted.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Alternatively, an IPv6 packet is standard-formed if it meets the
      following criteria:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The version field is 6.</t>

          <t>Either the packet possesses sufficient Hop Count to travel from
          the Source to the Destination if the Hop Count is decremented by one
          at each hop, or it possesses the maximum Hop Count of 255.</t>

          <t>Either the packet does not contain IP extension headers, or it
          contains the correct number and type of headers as explicitly noted,
          and the headers appear in the expected order (Next Header).</t>

          <t>All parameters used in the header and extension headers will be
          found in the IANA Registry of Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)
          Parameters <xref target="RFC7045"/>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The topic of IPv6 extension headers brings current controversies into
      focus. The following additional criteria apply when IPv6 extension
      headers are present:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Extension header modification: In hop-by-hop and Destination
          Options headers, some TLV encoded options may be permitted to change
          at intermediate nodes while in transit. </t>

          <t>Extension header insertion or deletion: It is possible that
          extension headers could be added to, or removed from the header
          chain.</t>

          <t>A change in length (from the corresponding packet observed at the
          source) is a significant factor in Internet measurement, and
          requires withdrawal of "standard-formed" status if the corresponding
          source packet had qualified with a different length (end-to-end
          principle).</t>
        </list>We further require that if a packet is described as having a
      "length of B octets", then 0 &lt;= B &lt;= 65535; and if B is the
      payload length in octets, then B &lt;= (65535-IP header size in octets,
      including any extension headers). The jumbograms defined in <xref
      target="RFC2675"/> are not covered by this length analysis. In practice,
      the path MTU will restrict the length of standard-formed packets that
      can successfully traverse the path.</t>

      <t>So, for example, one might imagine defining an IP connectivity metric
      as "IP-type-P-connectivity for standard-formed packets with the IP
      Diffserv field set to 0", or, more succinctly, "IP-type-P-connectivity
      with the IP Diffserv Field set to 0", since standard-formed is already
      implied by convention. Changing the contents of a field, such as the
      Diffserv Code Point, ECN bits, or Flow Label may have a profound affect
      on packet handling during transit, but does not affect a packet's status
      as standard-formed.</t>

      <t>A particular type of standard-formed packet often useful to consider
      is the "minimal IP packet from A to B" - this is an IP packet with the
      following properties:<list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="+">It is standard-formed.</t>

          <t hangText="+">Its data payload is 0 octets.</t>

          <t hangText="+">It contains no options or extension headers.</t>
        </list>(Note that we do not define its protocol field, as different
      values may lead to different treatment by the network.)</t>

      <t>When defining IP metrics we keep in mind that no packet smaller or
      simpler than this can be transmitted over a correctly operating IP
      network.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conclusions">
      <t>This memo adds the key considerations for utilizing IPv6 in two
      critical conventions of the IPPM Framework. It is RECOMMENDED to adopt
      these new considerations in measurements involving IPv6.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
      live paths are relevant here as well. See <xref target="RFC4656"/> and
      <xref target="RFC5357"/>.</t>

      <t>When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
      whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
      potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
      which are within this scope of work. Passive observations of user
      traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues. We refer the
      reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
      Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-lmap-framework"/>, which covers active and passive
      techniques.</t>
